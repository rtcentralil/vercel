# Self-discovery & Robotic Toys Will Help Develop Robotic Engineers

There will be a huge demand for robotic engineers in the coming years. As Steve Jurvetson, Board Member of SpaceX and Tesla, explained, “Machine learning allows us to build software solutions that exceed human understanding and show us how AI can innovate every industry.” While the idea of evil robots taking over our planet seems laughable, the reality is that robotics is infiltrating most industries and revealing our human limitations.

By introducing educational toys designed to promote self-discovery and educate kids about robotics and technology, you can steer your child in the right direction and help them develop the core skills they’ll need for a future career in robotic engineering. As the philosopher Plato once said, the direction in which education starts determines a person’s future. Exposing young minds to robotics, machine learning, and AI from an early age can set the foundation for success.

## Self-discovery & Education

Self-discovery and exploration are essential components of learning. Children absorb information rapidly, and hands-on experience is one of the most effective ways to retain knowledge. At RoboThink, we believe that nurturing self-discovery in children will help build the future leaders in science, math, technology, and engineering.

## Robotic Engineer Skills

To become a successful robotic engineer, one needs:
- A strong background in mathematics and science  
- Proficiency in coding and programming languages such as Java, Python, and C  
- The ability to think creatively and innovatively  

By exposing children to educational toys that inspire self-discovery and creativity, you are giving them the opportunity to develop these essential skills.
