# Saudi Arabia, RoboThink & Children’s Education

Saudi Arabia’s education system is undergoing significant reform and innovation, thanks to Vision 2030. In this article, we review the exciting changes that Saudi Arabia is rolling out in children’s education and how RoboThink has recently expanded to empower, educate, and inspire the next generation.

## What Is Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030?

King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud has set clear goals for the country’s education system to help close the gap between educational outcomes and job market requirements. As part of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia aims to develop a modern education system that equips students for future careers, with a goal to have at least 5 universities ranked among the top 200 in the world.

## Growing Demand For Children’s Education

Massive investments, such as The Knowledge Economic City in Medina, are drawing professionals and families from around the world, increasing the demand for high-quality children’s education. RoboThink’s expansion into Saudi Arabia comes at a time when the country is reimagining its approach to learning, particularly in technology and robotics.

## Preparing For The Future

With initiatives like a public investment fund and the development of an AI-supported mega-city, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as a leader in technology and innovation. RoboThink is here to support this vision by offering coding lessons, game design, and robotic engineering courses to prepare the next generation for a tech-driven future.
