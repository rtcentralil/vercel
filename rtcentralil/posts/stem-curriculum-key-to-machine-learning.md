# 3 Reasons Why STEM Curriculum Is Key To Machine Learning & Problem-solving

STEM lessons and resources revolve around science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, but why are these core skills key to the future generation? In this article, we’re going to reveal 3 key reasons why a STEM curriculum is the key to machine learning knowledge and problem-solving skills.

## 1: Empower The Future Generation

“Biologically driven neurological processes and natural curiosity of how the world works make early childhood an optimal time to introduce children to scientific inquiry” - Jennifer Buchter, UNLV Development Specialist. Childhood is the prime time to spark imagination, build problem-solving skills, and share our knowledge of the world.

It is our responsibility to empower children and inspire them to study the skills they’ll need to pursue future careers and industries that are only just emerging. By shaking up the way we approach education and adjusting it for the future, we can better equip the next generation. Technology is rapidly changing and any company or educational facility needs to keep up with this evolution of coding, machine learning, and AI to offer high-quality lessons and courses. This is our current mission at RoboThink—to inspire children to develop their skills in science, technology, engineering, and maths so that they have a strong foundation for the digital-first world.

## 2: Make Problem-solving Second Nature

Much of machine learning is built on problem-solving. Machines are given a set of instructions and then must learn from data and experiences to eventually solve problems independently. Helping children develop problem-solving skills is essential, not only to design and build robots but also to predict issues and think outside the box.

## 3: STEM Nurtures Young Minds

STEM may take more time to teach, but its return on investment is immeasurable. STEM lessons are based on real-world problems, from environmental challenges to economic issues. Introducing children to the practical applications of scientific methods, mathematical equations, and technological solutions reinforces the need to learn. When children see the relevance of these skills, their engagement and inspiration soar.

**STEM curriculum will help your child develop:**

- Problem-solving skills  
- Critical thinking  
- Creativity  
- Curiosity about the world  
- Decision-making skills  
- Leadership qualities  
- Entrepreneurship
