# Singapore Is Stepping Up Children’s Education

RoboThink has recently expanded to Singapore, bringing robotic kits, coding lessons, and opportunities for children to learn game design and app development. Singapore has long been recognized for its high standards in education, and now it’s taking a step further by incorporating cutting-edge technology into its curriculum.

## Why Singapore Puts Children’s Education First

Singapore’s Ministry of Education is committed to helping students discover and maximize their talents, ensuring they are well-prepared for a rapidly evolving global landscape. The country has consistently topped international rankings in literacy, math, and science, and its focus on integrating technology into education is set to continue.

## Embracing Digital Transformation

By introducing coding lessons and digital skills early on, Singapore is positioning its students to excel in a digital-first world. RoboThink’s expansion in Singapore is part of a broader movement to equip children with the skills needed to thrive in technology-driven industries.
