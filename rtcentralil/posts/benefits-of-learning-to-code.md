# 5 Benefits Of Learning To Code As A Child

Thomas Suarez understood the benefits of learning to code as a child! Now 21 years old, Thomas, a highly successful developer and entrepreneur, taught himself to code at the age of nine and began designing and developing apps on Apple’s App Store.

In 2012, at the age of 12, Thomas gave a TED talk about his experience coding as a child and his growing interest in game development. Thomas explained that children no longer want to simply play computer games—they now want to learn how to design and develop one themselves. Here are 5 benefits of learning to code as a child and why you should sign your young entrepreneur up for an online game development course.

## 1: Promising Job Prospects

Learning to code opens up a wide range of career opportunities. Even if children don’t pursue coding as a career, understanding programming enhances their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, making them more competitive in various fields.

## 2: Systematic, Step-by-Step Thinking

Coding teaches children to break down complex problems into manageable steps. This systematic approach, often referred to as computational thinking, is invaluable for academic and everyday challenges.

## 3: Unlock The Creative Mind

Coding stimulates creativity and innovation. By learning to design and develop games and apps, children can express their creativity in unique ways, developing ideas that could transform industries.

## 4: Embracing Failure & Building Resilience

Learning to code exposes children to the concept of trial and error. Embracing failure as part of the learning process builds resilience and encourages persistence.

## 5: Real-Life Application Of Maths

Coding offers practical applications of math, making abstract concepts more tangible. When children see how math is used in creating digital solutions, their interest and performance in math can significantly improve.

By learning to code early, children not only gain technical skills but also develop essential life skills that set them up for long-term success in an increasingly digital world.
